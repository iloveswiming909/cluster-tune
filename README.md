ClusterTune is an Android utility for tuning CPU frequency limits on supported handheld devices. It lets you adjust CPU clusters, save performance profiles, and access quick controls from an Android Quick Settings tile.

The app has been tested with the AYN Odin 3, but should be compatible with other AYN and Retroid devices.

ClusterTune does not require Magisk or user-granted root access. It relies on the device's built-in PServer service, where available.

> [!WARNING]
> ClusterTune changes CPU frequency limits. This may affect device stability, thermals, battery life, and performance, and I cannot guarantee that it is safe for your hardware or beneficial for your use case. Use it only if you understand what CPU frequency limits do and are comfortable accepting the risk.

## Why use this?

ClusterTune underclocks by setting lower maximum CPU frequencies. It does not undervolt the CPU, and it is not an adaptive governor; it simply caps how fast each CPU cluster is allowed to run.

Lower CPU frequency caps can reduce power draw, which may help lower temperatures, quiet the fan, and extend battery life. In some games, reducing CPU power and heat may also leave more thermal or power headroom for the GPU, especially when the game is GPU-bound.

## Features

- Tune CPU clusters with per-cluster frequency sliders.
- View the currently applied frequency cap for each cluster.
- Save, edit, delete, reorder, import, and export profiles.
- Use bundled profiles for supported devices.
- Reapply the last profile on boot.
- Quick Settings tile for fast access.
- Customizable quick tile behavior

## Requirements

- Android 12+ (`minSdk 31`).
- A compatible handheld with the PServer service, such as supported AYN and Retroid devices.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

Run both:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is produced under:

```text
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

```

## Bundled Profiles

Bundled profiles are stored as SoC-specific JSON files:

```text
app/src/main/assets/bundled_profiles/CQ8725S.json
```

The filename should match the detected SoC model, such as `ro.soc.model`.

Example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "socModel": "CQ8725S",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "id": "bundled_cq8725s_small",
      "name": "Small Underclock",
      "maxFrequencies": {
        "0": 2745600,
        "6": 3072000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Exported profiles follow the same schema.

## Notes For Contributors

- UI refers to cpufreq policies as CPU clusters, but internal code keeps `policy` naming because it matches Linux/sysfs terminology.
- ClusterTune uses the device's PServer service to read and write protected CPU frequency controls. It does not ask the user for root access.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

I used AI assistance while building this project. Software development is my day job, and I reviewed the code throughout the process. I understand how the app works and what it does.
